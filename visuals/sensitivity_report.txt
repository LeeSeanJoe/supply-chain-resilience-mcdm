SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS REPORT
======================================================================

1. PROBABILITY SENSITIVITY (COO, TOPSIS)
--------------------------------------------------
   No transitions found - ranking is stable across all probabilities tested.
   Finding: The recommendation is robust to cyber probability assumptions.

2. WEIGHT SENSITIVITY (COO, Cost weight, TOPSIS)
--------------------------------------------------
   At 5% cost weight: optimal shifts from C8 to C7
   At 30% cost weight: optimal shifts from C7 to C3
   At 40% cost weight: optimal shifts from C3 to C1

   Finding: The recommendation depends on cost prioritization.
